/*
✅ Problem: Find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to zero.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
- Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use nested brute force loops.
- Use sorting + two-pointer technique.

💡 Working Logic:
- Sort the array.
- Fix one element and use two pointers to find pairs that sum to -fixed.
