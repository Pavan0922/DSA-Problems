/*
✅ Problem: Find the minimum number of insertions required to make an array a palindrome.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [1, 3, 5, 3, 1]
- Output: 0 (already a palindrome)

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT reverse and compare entire array.
- Use two pointers to compare and decide insertions.

💡 Working Logic:
- Start from both ends.
- If elements don’t match, insert the smaller one and increment count.
