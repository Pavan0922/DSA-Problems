/*
✅ Problem: Find if there exists a pair with a given sum in a sorted array.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target = 6
- Output: true (2 + 4)

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use nested loops.
- Use two pointers only (since array is sorted).

💡 Working Logic:
- Use one pointer at start, one at end.
- Move pointers based on sum comparison with target.
