/*
✅ Problem: Find the maximum sum of any subarray of size K.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], K = 3
- Output: 9 (subarray: [5,1,3])

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use nested loops or brute-force.
- Must use sliding window approach.

💡 Working Logic:
- Calculate initial sum of first window.
- Slide the window forward by subtracting the left element and adding the right.
