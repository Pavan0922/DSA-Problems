/*
✅ Problem: Reverse the elements of the array.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use array.reverse().
- Do NOT use built-in methods like unshift(), push(), slice(), etc.
- Do NOT use additional arrays (do in-place).

💡 Working Logic:
- Use two pointers: start and end.
- Swap elements at start and end until they meet in the middle.
