/*
✅ Problem: Move all 0s in the array to the end, maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
- Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use built-in filter(), sort(), or array copying.
- Do NOT use new arrays to store results (must do in-place).

💡 Working Logic:
- Use two-pointer approach.
- Pointer `j` tracks the position of the next non-zero.
- Traverse the array: if arr[i] is not zero, swap it with arr[j] and increment j.
