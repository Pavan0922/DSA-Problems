/*
✅ Problem: Remove duplicates from a sorted array and return the length of unique elements.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
- Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (first 4 elements), return 4

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use Set or Map.
- Do NOT use additional arrays.
- Must be done in-place with O(1) extra space.

💡 Working Logic:
- Use two-pointer technique.
- `i` points to the last unique element found.
- `j` iterates through the array.
- When arr[i] != arr[j], increment i and copy arr[j] to arr[i].
