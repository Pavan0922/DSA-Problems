✅ Problem: Sort an array using Insertion Sort.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
- Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use built-in sort methods.
- Implement manually using shifting and inserting elements at correct positions.

💡 Working Logic:
- Iterate from second element.
- Place each element at its correct position in the sorted part.
