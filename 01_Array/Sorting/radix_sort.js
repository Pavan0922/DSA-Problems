/*
✅ Problem: Sort a list of integers using Radix Sort.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]
- Output: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use built-in sort methods.
- Must implement digit-wise sorting using counting sort.

💡 Working Logic:
- Sort elements by each digit from least to most significant.
- Use stable sort (e.g., counting sort) for each digit.
