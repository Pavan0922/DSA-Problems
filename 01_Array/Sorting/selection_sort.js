/*
✅ Problem: Sort an array using Selection Sort.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
- Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use built-in sort methods.
- Find the minimum in the unsorted part and swap with the first unsorted element.

💡 Working Logic:
- Repeatedly find the minimum element and move it to the beginning.
