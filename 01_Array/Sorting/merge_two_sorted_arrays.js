/*
✅ Problem: Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]
- Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use built-in sort or concat.
- Merge manually by comparing elements from both arrays.

💡 Working Logic:
- Use two pointers to compare and insert elements from both arrays in sorted order.
