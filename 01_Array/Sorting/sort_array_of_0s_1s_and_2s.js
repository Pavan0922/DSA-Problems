/*
✅ Problem: Sort an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [0, 2, 1, 2, 0]
- Output: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use sort methods or counting.
- Use one-pass in-place sorting (Dutch National Flag Algorithm).

💡 Working Logic:
- Use three pointers: low, mid, high.
- Rearrange elements based on their value.
