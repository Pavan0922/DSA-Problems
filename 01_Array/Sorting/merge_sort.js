/*
✅ Problem: Sort an array using Merge Sort.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
- Output: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use built-in sort methods.
- Must use divide and conquer technique.
- Use recursion to divide, and merge sorted arrays.

💡 Working Logic:
- Recursively divide the array in halves.
- Merge sorted halves back together.
