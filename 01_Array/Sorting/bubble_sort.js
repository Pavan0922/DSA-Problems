// Bubble Sort 
/*
✅ Problem: Sort an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
- Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use built-in sort methods.
- Must use nested loops to compare and swap adjacent elements.

💡 Working Logic:
- Repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap if out of order.
- Pushes the largest unsorted element to the end in each pass.
