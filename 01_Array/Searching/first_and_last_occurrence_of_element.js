✅ Problem: Find the first and last occurrence of an element in a sorted array.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 2
- Output: [1, 3]

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use indexOf() or lastIndexOf().
- Must solve using two binary search passes.

💡 Working Logic:
- First binary search for first occurrence.
- Second binary search for last occurrence.
