/*
✅ Problem: Search for a target element in a sorted array using Binary Search.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], target = 5
- Output: 2 (index of target)

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use built-in methods like indexOf().
- Must implement Binary Search manually (iterative or recursive).

💡 Working Logic:
- Set low = 0, high = arr.length - 1
- Repeat while low <= high: find mid, compare with target, move left/right
