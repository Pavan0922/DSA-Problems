/*
✅ Problem: Find a peak element in the array (greater than its neighbors).

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: arr = [1, 3, 20, 4, 1, 0]
- Output: 2 (index of 20)

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use linear scan.
- Must use Binary Search approach.

💡 Working Logic:
- At each mid, compare with neighbors.
- If mid is peak, return it. Else, move to side where a bigger element exists.
