/*
✅ Problem: Find the floor value of the square root of a number using binary search.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: num = 17
- Output: 4 (since sqrt(17) ≈ 4.12)

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use Math.sqrt() or any built-in root function.
- Must implement using binary search approach.

💡 Working Logic:
- Set low = 1, high = num
- Use binary search to find the largest mid such that mid*mid <= num
