/*
✅ Problem: Search for an element in an array using Linear Search.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: arr = [5, 3, 8, 6], target = 8
- Output: 2

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use any built-in search functions.
- Must use a loop to search manually.

💡 Working Logic:
- Traverse the array from start to end.
- If element matches target, return the index.
