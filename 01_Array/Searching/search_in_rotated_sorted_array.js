/*
✅ Problem: Search for an element in a sorted array that has been rotated.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
- Output: 4

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use linear search.
- Must use modified binary search.

💡 Working Logic:
- Use binary search and identify which half is sorted.
- Narrow search space based on where target lies.
