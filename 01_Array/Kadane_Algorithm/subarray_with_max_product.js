/*
✅ Problem: Find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [2, 3, -2, 4]
- Output: 6 (product of subarray [2, 3])

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use nested loops.
- Do NOT use built-in max() or reduce() with product.
- Must be done in O(N) time.

💡 Working Logic:
- Use variables: maxSoFar, minSoFar, result.
- At each step, track max and min because of negative numbers.
