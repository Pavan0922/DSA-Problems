/*
✅ Problem: Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

⚙️ Expected Functionality:
- Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
- Output: 6 (subarray [4, -1, 2, 1])

🚫 Restrictions:
- Do NOT use nested loops.
- Do NOT use reduce() or built-in sum methods.
- Must be done in O(N) time.

💡 Working Logic:
- Initialize maxSoFar = arr[0], currentMax = arr[0].
- Loop through the array, update currentMax and maxSoFar accordingly.
